#### A space-themed image placeholder service.

## Usage

Jamming on a prototype? Cranking on buildout but you don't have content images from your client yet? Drop the following in your markup and marvel at the wonders of the universe:

```html
<img src="https://spaceholder.cc/400x300" alt="This is an awesome spaceholder!">
```

Replace `400x300` with whatever pixel dimensions you like: `200x50`, `1200x400`, `240x240`. You'll be traveling the outer reaches so long as the format is a number, an `x` (the letter "x"), and another number. For sanity's sake, both dimensions may be no larger than 5000.

If you'd like a square image, use a single number in the URL:

```html
<img src="https://spaceholder.cc/400" alt="This is an awesome square spaceholder!">
```
